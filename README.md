# Stock-price-prediction
In this project “STOCK MARKET PREDICTION” is done by using Auto
Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model in Python, which is one of
the most commonly used Statistical techniques for Time Series Forecasting. We build
the model by doing applying Preprocessing technique, Exploratory Data Analysis,
Stationarizing the Data and use ARIMA model based on the parameters or degrees of
model. These methods are applied on 5 years of data retrieved from Tata Global
Beverages. The results will be used to analyze the stock prices and their prediction in
depth in future.
• Moreover other methods like Auto ARIMA and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)
have been used for more accuracy of the prediction.
